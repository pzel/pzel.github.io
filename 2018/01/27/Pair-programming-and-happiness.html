  <h2>What this post is about</h2>

<p>Every time an article about pair programming surfaces in one of the Internet's
watering holes, I am surprised by the amount of negativity surrounding the
practice.</p>

<p>In this post, I suggest two modifications to "standard" pair programming, which
should make it more enjoyable, even for introverts and skilled experts.</p>

<h2>People complain</h2>

<p>Reading the top top-rated comments in <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/wyd3di/do_you_pair_program">one of many threads on
pairing</a>, one sees critical comments like these:</p>

<blockquote><p>I can’t stand pair programming, and I simply would not work somewhere that required it.</p>

<p>Pair programming (..)? Super not a fan.</p>

<p>I’m personally strongly against it.</p></blockquote>

<p>While I haven't done a through qualitative study on the sentiments expressed,
one of the main arguments against pairing seems to be the fact that programmers
don't enjoy being forced to socialize against their will.
This forced socialization entails things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>sharing the keyboard</li>
<li>sharing editor settings</li>
<li>close physical proximity to the other member of the pair</li>
</ul>


<p>The other counterargument centers around the difficulties in matching skill and
experience levels between the two members of a pair. Here, the following come up:</p>

<ul>
<li>two experienced programmers do more work separately then when pairing</li>
<li>two juniors will not learn anything from each other</li>
<li>it makes sense to pair juniors with seniors only during the onboarding period</li>
</ul>


<p>This skills-based barrier to pleasurable and productive pairing is indeed more
serious, but I have seen it overcome with a small shift in attitude and
approach.</p>

<p>Below, I'd like to present the paring setup and techniques that I've used (and
seen used) in the last few years. I believe that they alleviate some of the
misgivings about pair programming mentioned above.</p>

<h2>Introverts, separate!</h2>

<p>I've done most my professional work remotely. A lot of the code I've
(co-)developed was written in a pair-programming+TDD setting, <strong>remotely</strong>.</p>

<p>How does one effectively pair-program when not at the same desk? I'm not the
first person to recommend the classic <code>ssh + tmux</code> solution. I believe
this solution is <strong>strictly better</strong> than pair programming at one desk.</p>

<p>It works like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The team sets up a shared development box, accessible by ssh/mosh</li>
<li>A pair of team members logs in, <code>tmux a</code>ttaches to a shared terminal</li>
<li>They run <del>vim</del> emacs inside</li>
<li>They use a separate app for audio. (Mumble, Skype, Slack calls, etc.)</li>
</ol>


<p>This solution is so good, that I've even used it while working in the same room
as the pairing partner (sans voice app, of course). It provides both parties
with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_attention">shared locus of attention</a>, while not exposing them to physical
discomfort.</p>

<p>While this solution clearly eliminates physical issues around pairing, the
problem of a shared programming environment remains. As pair programming
requires practitioners to be fluent with the tools they use day-to-day,
fundamentally there will always be a need for compromise on this front.</p>

<p>Practially, however, most backend programmers will be familiar with either vim
or emacs—a judicous use of toggles for switching between setting groups
should sort out personal quirks. (For example: at work we bind <code>&lt;F4&gt;</code> to switch
emacs from vanilla behavior to <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">evil-mode</a>. It works well enough.)</p>

<h2>Jamming is conversation</h2>

<p>The other issue is related to skill levels. Simplifying skill levels to a
binary of <em>junior</em> and <em>senior</em>, we get 3 possible pairings: both juniors, both
seniors, and junior+senior.</p>

<p>The junior+senior combination seems to be the most highly regarded use case for
pair programming, even among the detractors. It makes sense that putting the
less experienced in close quarters with a seasoned master should benefit the
junior. Even in these cases, I can imagine that some seniors may feel that
their time isn't being put to good use, while some juniors might get
overwhelmed watching their mentor work with great efficiency. This leads to
fatigue and 'just watching' as the other person works—definitely a waste of
both the devs' time and the employer's money.</p>

<p>The key to getting the most our of pair programming is to <strong>A</strong>lways <strong>B</strong>e
<strong>C</strong>oding. The common pairing methodology of driver and navigator switching
roles every 30 minutes is tedious and wasteful. I believe that turning the
coding session into a jam session is the key to making pairing work.</p>

<p>How to keep both parties engaged and coding? If you're applying TDD, it's easy:
just do ping-pong pairing. Develeloper A writes a test. Developer B writes
enough of an implementation to make the test pass, then continues with another
test. Developer A picks up, and modifies the implementation to meet the demands.</p>

<p>This kind of call-and-response style of development keeps both parties focused
on the code, talking and thinking about the task at hand. While TDD works most
of the time, there exist some issues which cannot be simply reduced to a test
case. Here, still, the challenge-and-reply approach does wonders for code
quality and developer engagement. (For example: one developer might challenge
the other by saying: "There is a more efficient algorithm", or "I can break
this mechanism like so. How will you fix it?", etc.)</p>

<p>By approaching pair programming as a conversation, we can get more mileage out
of any combination of skill levels. For two juniors, the back and forth may
touch on unit test design or knowledge of the system. Two seniors pairing will
get opportunities to critically examine and revise system architecture or
coding standards, but the possibilities for jamming are endless. They may even
involve betting money (sic!).</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Above, I described two tweaks to pair programming practice that, in my
experience, make it much more enjoyable. To summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>A remote shared workstation may alleviate the physical discomfort of pairing</li>
<li>Call-and-response jamming will keep both devs engaged, learning, and focued
on the code, regardless of skill levels</li>
</ul>


<p>This concludes my humble contribution to the ongoing conversation around pair
programming.</p>
